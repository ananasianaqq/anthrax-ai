core:
    - event class & event manager
function newlevel:
    - handle classes with already existing or newly created resource types
    - FOR NOW: leave as it is, since it's IMGUI
    --------------
Parser class:
    - Init Parser class somewhere at the beginning, before level manager
    - loadlevel():
        - can read
        1. has to receive filename from IMGUI input
        2. clear existing resourcs, reserve vectors
        3. use Parser class, start reading stream
        4. call something like GetAttribute("Player") etc
        5. inside found attr --> for different type call different GetString/GetInt/GetFloat etc
    - savelevel():
        - can write
        *1. will be nice to make some nicer thing for naming levels, but not now =)
        2. insead of `outfile << playerinfo << std::endl;` use Parser pbject and call something like AddAttribute<Player>() ! 
        3. then check if GetAttribute<Player> the inside smth like addattr<int>(ID) etc
        4. then write changes to file
