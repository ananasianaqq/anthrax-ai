1. process material loading; connection between model class and resource data structure

2. parser for 3d levels? improve 2d/3d modes handling

3. fix lighting; direction ligting; point lights

----------

Ambitious:
- completely rewrite engine architecture
(probably combine this with streams, but at separate time work on the features for anthraxAI and make videos)

----------


parser thoughts:

- two folders: levels/2d and levels/3d

- if we are in 2d mode -> parse 2d level
- if we are in 3d mode -> parse 3d level

- 3d level text: 
    - model path
    - input texture (also check whether model contains material)
    - position (x y z)
    - is animation
        - path to other animations
        - speed

(add some basic assertions eg if we are passing correct node names)

implementation details:
    - recursive function Parse()
